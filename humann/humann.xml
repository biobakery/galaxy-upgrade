        HUMAnN is a pipeline for efficiently and accurately profiling the presence/absence and abundance of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequencing data (typically millions of short DNA/RNA reads). This process, referred to as functional profiling, aims to describe the metabolic potential of a microbial community and its members. More generally, functional profiling answers the question "What are the microbes in my community-of-interest doing (or capable of doing)?"

#### Features
1. Community functional profiles stratified by known and unclassified organisms
- MetaPhlAn and ChocoPhlAn pangenome database are used to facilitate fast, accurate, and organism-specific functional profiling
- Organisms included are Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryotes, and Viruses

2. Considerably expanded databases of genomes, genes, and pathways
- UniRef database provides gene family definitions
MetaCyc provides pathway definitions by gene family
MinPath is run to identify the set of minimum pathways

3. A simple user interface (single command driven flow)
- The user only needs to provide a quality-controlled metagenome or metatranscriptome

4. Accelerated mapping of reads to reference databases (including run-time generated databases tailored to the input)
- Bowtie2 is run for accelerated nucleotide-level searches
- Diamond is run for accelerated translated searches
